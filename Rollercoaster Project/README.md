# Roller Coaster Project
The intention of this project was to practice some exploratory data analysis, as well as visualizing data with matplotlib.

My favorite outcome from working on this project was the creation of a reusable function in which I can now pass two arguments: a DataFrame and the column_name of a nominal categorical variable from that dataframe, and it will output a bar chart of the counts of each category.  (Sampled here)
