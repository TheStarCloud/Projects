# Employee Turnover Power BI Project
This was my first independent project where I practiced with Power BI.  
The biggest part of this project for me was tidying and wrangling the data before creating the visualizations.

After that, I was looking at the stats for gender differences in the data, and whether having the gender of an employee's supervisor match that of the employee made a difference in whether there was turnover.  As it turns out, this did not have a significant impact on turnover.
The data source also included data on how employees rated in different categories of a personality matrix test, so I was interested to see if different aspects of an employee's personality had an impact on turnover; there wasn't much of a significant impact here either.

What I found instead, was that the largest influencer on employee turnover was the profession or industry that the employee worked in, with Teachers having the highest turnover rate.
It is worth noting, however, that the distribution of professions of the employees in this data set is not evenly distributed; the vast majority of employees recorded were identified as working in HR; the sample sizes for other professions was notably smaller.
